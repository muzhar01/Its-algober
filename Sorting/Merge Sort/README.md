# Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort

This project contains implementations of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python, C, and Java.

## Problem Overview

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science, allowing us to arrange data in a specific order. Merge Sort is a popular comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer paradigm to efficiently sort lists.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, demonstrating how to sort an array using this method.

### Implementations

- **Python**: The Python implementation uses a recursive approach to split the array into halves, sort them, and then merge the sorted halves back together.

- **C**: The C implementation uses a similar recursive strategy, with a dedicated `merge` function to combine the sorted subarrays.

- **Java**: The Java implementation follows the same recursive approach as in Python and C, encapsulating the merge logic within a class.

### Usage

To run the examples:

1. **Python**: Execute the `merge_sort.py` file using Python 3.
2. **C**: Compile and run the `merge_sort.c` file using a C compiler.
3. **Java**: Compile and run the `MergeSort.java` file using the Java Development Kit (JDK).

### Conclusion

This project serves as an introduction to sorting algorithms and demonstrates the implementation of Merge Sort. Contributions are welcome to expand on this foundation with more complex algorithms and features.
